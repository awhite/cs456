To run:

	Start the emulator:

	> ./nEmulator \
		<emulator's-receiving-UDP-numbers-in-forward(sender)-direction> \
		<receiver-network-address> \
		<receiver-UDP-port> \
		<emulator's-receiving-UDP-numbers-in-backward(receiver)-direction> \
		<sender-network-address> \
		<sender-UDP-port> \
		<max-delay-of-link(milliseconds)> \
		<packet-discard-probability> \
		0


	Start the receiver:

	> java Receiver \
		<hostname-where-emulator-is-running> \
		<emulator's-receiving-UDP-numbers-in-backward(receiver)-direction> \
		<receiver-UDP-port> \
		<filename-for-received-data>


	Start the sender:

	> java Sender \
		<hostname-where-emulator-is-running> \
		<emulator's-receiving-UDP-numbers-in-forward(sender)-direction> \
		<sender-UDP-port> \
		<filename-for-data-to-send>
